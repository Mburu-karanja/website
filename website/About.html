         <h3>Our Story</h3> 
         <p>E-Bag Shop was founded in 2023 by Mburu Karanja. Mburu had the vision to start an online retailer that specialized in high quality bags at affordable prices.

            He launched E-Bag Shop from his hometown of Juja with an initial investment of KSHs/= 50,000. The early website offered around 50 products covering categories like handbags, backpacks and wallets.
            
            Within the first month the variety of bags were expanded to over 100 styles from independent designers. Partnerships were also formed with emerging labels. Increased traffic to the site led to the hiring of two employees to help with customer service and operations.
            
          E-Bag Shop has grown exponentially due to its trendy yet affordable collections. 
            International shipping was introduced in april through distribution agreements with overseas carriers. New categories like luggage, tech accessories and travel bags were added.
            
             It has emerged as a major global online retailer with millions of customers.
